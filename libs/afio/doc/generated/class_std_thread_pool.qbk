'''<indexterm><primary>std_thread_pool</primary></indexterm>'''
A very simple thread pool based on std::thread or boost::thread. 

[heading Description]
This instantiates a [^`boost::asio::io_service`] and a latchable [^`boost::asio::io_service::work`] to keep any threads working until the instance is destructed. 

[heading Synopsis]
``class std_thread_pool
      : public thread_source
{
  // ...
};
