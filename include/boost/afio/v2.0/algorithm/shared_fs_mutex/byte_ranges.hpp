    \brief Many entity shared/exclusive file system based lock

    This is a simple many entity shared mutex. It works by locking in the same file the byte at the
    offset of the entity id. If it fails to lock a byte, it backs out all preceding locks, randomises the order
    and tries locking them again until success. Needless to say this algorithm puts a lot of strain on
    your byte range locking implementation, some NFS implementations have been known to fail to cope.

    - Compatible with networked file systems, though be cautious with older NFS.
    - Linear complexity to number of concurrent users.
    - Exponential complexity to number of entities being concurrently locked, though some OSs
    provide linear complexity so long as total concurrent waiting processes is CPU core count or less.
    - Does a reasonable job of trying to sleep the thread if any of the entities are locked.
    - Sudden process exit with lock held is recovered from.
    - Sudden power loss during use is recovered from.
    - Safe for multithreaded usage of the same instance.

    Caveats:
    - When entities being locked is more than one, the algorithm places the contending lock at the
    front of the list during the randomisation after lock failure so we can sleep the thread until
    it becomes free. However, under heavy churn the thread will generally spin, consuming 100% CPU.
    - Byte range locks need to work properly on your system. Misconfiguring NFS or Samba
    to cause byte range locks to not work right will produce bad outcomes.
    - If your OS doesn't have sane byte range locks (OS X, BSD, older Linuxes) and multiple
    objects in your process use the same lock file, misoperation will occur. Use lock_files
    or share a single instance of this class per lock file in this case.
