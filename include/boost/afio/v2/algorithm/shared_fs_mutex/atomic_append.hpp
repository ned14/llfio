    \brief Scalable many entity shared/exclusive file system based lock

    Lock files and byte ranges scale poorly to the number of items being concurrently locked with typically an exponential
    drop off in performance as the number of items being concurrently locked rises. This file system
    algorithm solves this problem using IPC via a shared append-only lock file.

    - Compatible with networked file systems (NFS too if the special nfs_compatibility flag is true).
    - Invariant complexity to number of entities being locked.
    - Linear complexity to number of processes concurrently using the lock (i.e. number of waiters).
    - Very fast skip code path for when there is a just a single user.
    - Optionally can sleep until a lock becomes free in a power-efficient manner.
    - Sudden process exit with lock held causes a stall of a second or so to the other users, but
    is recovered correctly.
    - Sudden power loss during use is recovered from.

    Caveats:
    - Maximum of twelve entities may be locked concurrently.
    - Wasteful of disk space if used on a non-extents based filing system (e.g. FAT32, ext3).
    It is best used in `/tmp` if possible. If you really must use a non-extents based filing
    system, destroy and recreate the object instance periodically to force resetting the lock
    file's length to zero.
    - Similarly older operating systems (e.g. Linux < 3.0) do not implement extent hole punching
    and therefore will also see excessive disk space consumption. Note at the time of writing
    OS X doesn't implement hole punching at all.
    - Byte range locks need to work properly on your system. Misconfiguring NFS or Samba
    to cause byte range locks to not work right will produce bad outcomes.
    - If your OS doesn't have sane byte range locks (OS X, BSD, older Linuxes) and multiple
    threads in your process use the same lock file, bad things will happen due to the lack
    of sanity in POSIX byte range locks. This may get fixed with a process-local byte range
    lock implementation if there is demand, otherwise simply don't use the same lock file
    from more than one thread on such systems.
