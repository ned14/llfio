  extent chunks written to be stored irrespective of whatever the maximum file extent
  was set to.

  For various historical reasons, extents-based storage is disabled by default in newly
  created files on NTFS, unlike in almost every other major filing system. You have to
  explicitly "opt in" to extents-based storage.

  /*! Returns the current path of the open handle as said by the operating system. Note
  that you are NOT guaranteed that any path refreshed bears any resemblance to the original,
  some operating systems will return some different path which still reaches the same inode
  via some other route e.g. hardlinks, dereferenced symbolic links, etc. Windows and
  Linux correctly track changes to the specific path the handle was opened with,
  not getting confused by other hard links. MacOS nearly gets it right, but under some
  circumstances e.g. renaming may switch to a different hard link's path which is almost
  certainly a bug.

  If LLFIO was not able to determine the current path for this open handle e.g. the inode
  has been unlinked, it returns an empty path. Be aware that FreeBSD can return an empty
  (deleted) path for file inodes no longer cached by the kernel path cache, LLFIO cannot
  detect the difference. FreeBSD will also return any path leading to the inode if it is
  hard linked. FreeBSD does implement path retrieval for directory inodes
  correctly however, and see `algorithm::cached_parent_handle_adapter<T>` for a handle
  adapter which makes use of that.

  On Linux if `/proc` is not mounted, this call fails with an error. All APIs in LLFIO
  which require the use of `current_path()` can be told to not use it e.g. `flag::disable_safety_unlinks`.
  It is up to you to detect if `current_path()` is not working, and to change how you
  call LLFIO appropriately.

  On Windows, you will almost certainly get back a path of the form `\!!\Device\HarddiskVolume10\Users\ned\...`.
  See `path_view` for what all the path prefix sequences mean, but to summarise the `\!!\`
  prefix is LLFIO-only and will not be accepted by other Windows APIs. Pass LLFIO derived
  paths through the function `to_win32_path()` to Win32-ise them. This function is also
  available on Linux where it does nothing, so you can use it in portable code.

  \warning This call is expensive, it always asks the kernel for the current path, and no
  checking is done to ensure what the kernel returns is accurate or even sensible.
  Be aware that despite these precautions, paths are unstable and **can change randomly at
  any moment**. Most code written to use absolute file systems paths is **racy**, so don't
  do it, use `path_handle` to fix a base location on the file system and work from that anchor
  instead!

  \mallocs At least one malloc for the `path_type`, likely several more.
  \sa `algorithm::cached_parent_handle_adapter<T>` which overrides this with an
  implementation based on retrieving the current path of a cached handle to the parent
  directory. On platforms with instability or failure to retrieve the correct current path
  for regular files, the cached parent handle adapter works around the problem by
  taking advantage of directory inodes not having the same instability problems on any
  platform.

Each `handle` implementation provides one or more static member functions used to construct it.
Each of these has a descriptive, unique name so it can be used as a free function which is
convenient and intuitive for human programmers.

This design pattern is however inconvenient for generic code which needs a single way
of constructing some arbitrary unknown `handle` implementation. This shim function
provides that.
