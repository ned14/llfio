This is the beginnings of the post-peer-review AFIO
v2 rewrite. You can view its documentation at https://ned14.github.io/boost.afio/


Todo:
- [ ] Somehow implement make_errored_result(errcode, extended_msg)
- [ ] Move caching into native_handle_type.
- [ ] Implement [[bindlib::make_free]] which injects member functions into the enclosing
namespace.
- [ ] Add macro helpers to Outcome for returning outcomes out of things
which cannot return values like constructors, and convert said exceptions/TLS
back into outcomes.
 - Make use of std::system_error(errno, system_category, "custom error message");
- [ ] Get Outcome to work perfectly with exceptions and RTTI disabled, this makes
Outcome useful in the games/audio world.
  - [ ] Where Outcome might throw, do macro based action which could be any of:
   - Throw an exception
   - Call a deliberately undefined function to create a link error (release) or
assert & trap (debug)
   - Some user based action e.g. fatal exit
  - [ ] Add unit tests proving it for all platforms.
  - [ ] Move AFIO to being tested with exceptions and RTTI disabled.
- [ ] There is much duplicate and sloppy code in AFIO v2. Reduce and eliminate.

- [ ] C bindings for all AFIO v2 APIs. Write libclang parser which autogenerates
SWIG interface files from the .hpp files.

- [ ] Add native BSD kqueues to POSIX AIO backend as is vastly more efficient.
  - http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=607373&seqNum=4 is a
very useful programming guide for POSIX AIO.
- [ ] Port to Linux KAIO
  - http://linux.die.net/man/2/io_getevents would be in the run() loop.
pthread_sigqueue() can be used by post() to cause aio_suspend() to break
early to run user supplied functions.
- [ ] Add to docs for every API the number of malloc + free performed.
  - Unit test op codes generated per set of i/o calls 
- [ ] Don't run the cpu and sys tests if cpu and sys ids already in fs_probe_results.yaml
  - Need to uniquely fingerprint a machine somehow?
- [ ] Fatter afio::path. We probably need to allow relative paths
based on a handle and fragment in afio::path, therefore might as well encapsulate
NT kernel vs win32 paths in there too.
- [ ] Add monitoring of CPU usage to tests. See GetThreadTimes. Make sure
worker thread times are added into results.
- [ ] Configurable tracking of op latency and throughput (bytes) for all
handles on some storage i.e. storage needs to be kept in a global map.
  - Something which strongly resembles the memory bandwidth test
  - [ ] Should have decile bucketing e.g. percentage in bottom 10%, percentage
  in next 10% etc. Plus mean and stddev.
  - [ ] Should either be resettable or subtractable i.e. points can be diffed.
  - [ ] Add IOPS QD=1..N storage profile test
  - [ ] Add throughput storage profile test
- [ ] Output into YAML comparable hashes for OS + device + FS + flags
so we can merge partial results for some combo into the results database.
- [ ] Write YAML parsing tool which merges fs_probe_results.yaml into
the results directory where flags and OS get its own directory and each YAML file
is named FS + device e.g.
  - results/win64 direct=1 sync=0/NTFS + WDC WD30EFRX-68EUZN0
- [ ] virtual handle::path_type handle::path(bool refresh=false) should be added using
GetFinalPathNameByHandle(FILE_NAME_OPENED). VOLUME_NAME_DOS vs VOLUME_NAME_NT should
depend on the current afio::path setting.
- [ ] directory_handle
- [ ] symlink_handle
- [ ] Missing functions on handle/file_handle from AFIO v1
